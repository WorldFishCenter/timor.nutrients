#### Abstract
Small-scale fisheries are a crucial source of nutrient-dense aquatic foods in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), yet practical tools to manage these fisheries to optimize nutritional outcomes in an ecosystem approach remain limited. We present an analytical framework and predictive model of fishery nutrient profiles under typical multispecies, multi-gear situations. Using six-years of catch data from Timor-Leste, we modelled how different fishing methods, habitats, vessel types and seasons influence the yield of nutrients of public health significance. Our results demonstrate that fishing method and habitat are strong predictors of catch nutritional profiles. Importantly, different combinations of fishing strategies can achieve similar nutritional outcomes, indicating complementary management pathways to enhance nutrient availability for communities while balancing ecological, economic, and human wellbeing goals. This replicable framework provides actionable insights for nutrition-sensitive fisheries management and offers data-driven guidance for policies aimed at improving food and nutrition security in LMICs.
