Estimated Catch (EC): This dataset provides a broader view of catch data on a regional level. It is created by combining RC with additional information, including the frequency of fishing trips made by each fishing boat and the total number of boats surveyed (censused) in each municipality. This combination extrapolates the recorded catch data to a larger scale. 2.1 Catch weight and nutrional content The total estimated catch weight is determined by the number of individuals and the length range of each catch. Specifically, during the initial phase of the Peskas project (July 2017 - April 2019), the standard length measurement used was the fork length (FL), which later changed to the total length (TL) in the subsequent and current version of the project. We utilized the API service offered by the FishBase database to incorporate length-to-length and length-to-weight conversion tables, using information from survey landings to calculate the weight in grams based on the following formula: W = a × L^b Here, W represents the weight in grams, L is the total length (TL) in centimeters, and a and b are the conversion parameters obtained from FishBase for each fish species. The FishBase database provides length-to-length and length-to-weight relationships for over 5,000 fish species. Typically, there are multiple records for the parameters a and b for each species. Since the length measurements in Peskas’ first version pertained to FL, we initially standardized all length measurements to TL using the FishBase length-to-length conversion tables. Subsequently, we applied the TL-to-weight conversion tables to estimate the weights. The FishBase length-to-weight conversion tables offer species-level taxonomic resolution. To derive a singular length-to-weight relationship for each fish group, we calculated the median values of parameters a and b for all species within a particular fish group. To ensure relevance to the region of interest, we refined the species list using FAO country codes (https://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/iso3list/en/) pertinent to Timor-Leste and Indonesia (country codes 626 and 360, respectively). For instance, to ascertain the weight of a catch categorized under the fish group labeled ECN (representing the Echeneidae family), we first identified the species within ECN documented in Timor-Leste and Indonesia. After this, we computed the average values of the parameters a and b for the identified species, which in this case were Echeneis naucrates and Remora remora (as illustrated in the figure below). To address the scarcity of measured nutrient values for fish, which are typically limited to a few species and countries. To overcome this data limitation, MacNeil et al. developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that leverages both phylogenetic information and trait-based information to predict concentrations of seven essential nutrients: calcium, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, selenium, vitamin A, and zinc for both marine and inland fish species globally (see Hicks et al. 2019). For each catch, the nutritional yield was calculated by combining the validated weight estimates for each fish group with the modelled nutrient concentrations. Specifically, we used the highest posterior predictive density values for each of the seven nutrients, which can be found in the repository (https://github.com/mamacneil/NutrientFishbase). For non-fish groups—including octopuses, squids, cockles, shrimps, crabs, and lobsters—nutritional yield information was not available in the NutrientFishbase repository models. We retrieved the necessary data for these groups from the Global food composition database, using the same methodological approach as for the fish groups to estimate their nutritional content. To represent the nutrient concentration associated with each fish group, we used the median value as a summarizing metric. ## ℹ Downloading rfish-table__20231109005759_fe395e3__.rds ✔ Saved rfish-table__20231109005759_fe395e3__.rds to rfish-table__20231109005759_fe395e3__.rds ( 159.2 K… ## Rows: 515 Columns: 13── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (4): integragency_code, food_name, habitat, food_state ## dbl (9): food_id, ISSCAAP, protein(g), calcium(mg), iron(mg), zinc(mg), selenium(mcg), vitaminA(mcg), ... ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. ## Warning: There were 17 warnings in `dplyr::mutate()`. ## The first warning was: ## ℹ In argument: `ic = se * qt((1 - 0.05)/2 + 0.5, n - 1)`. ## ℹ In group 5: `interagency_code = &quot;BWH&quot;`. ## Caused by warning in `qt()`: ## !

We aimed to determine the most appropriate number of distinct groups, or “clusters,” present in our dataset. To achieve this, we used the total within sum of square (WSS) to identify the point at which grouping additional data points together does not significantly improve the clarity of the clustering. Once we established the optimal number of clusters, we applied the K-means clustering method. This is a widely-used technique that organizes data into clusters based on similarity. In our case, we grouped fishing trips together if they showed similar levels of nutrient concentrations. By doing this, we were able to observe patterns and categorize the trips according to their nutritional profiles. 5.2 Results Figure 5.1: Cluster analysis of nutrient profiles using k-means clustering. The scatter plot visualizes the distribution of data points in a two-dimensional space defined by the first two principal components which explain 38.6% and 24.5% of the variance, respectively.The convex hulls represent the boundaries of each cluster, providing a visual guide to the cluster density and separation. Figure 5.2: Distribution of nutrient adequacy across k-means clusters. The bar chart represents the number of individuals meeting the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) per 1kg of catch for each nutrient within different clusters. Each bar is segmented into six categories corresponding to the nutrients analyzed: calcium (dark purple), iron (blue), omega-3 (green), protein (teal), vitamin A (dark teal), and zinc (yellow). Clusters are labeled on the y-axis, indicating distinct groupings based on nutrient profile similarities derived from the cluster analysis. The x-axis quantifies the number of individuals who meet the RNI, highlighting the variation in nutritional fulfillment across clusters.
