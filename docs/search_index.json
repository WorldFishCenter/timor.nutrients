Estimated Catch (EC): This dataset provides a broader view of catch data on a regional level. It is created by combining RC with additional information, including the frequency of fishing trips made by each fishing boat and the total number of boats surveyed (censused) in each municipality. This combination extrapolates the recorded catch data to a larger scale. 2.1 Catch weight and nutrional content The total estimated catch weight is determined by the number of individuals and the length range of each catch. Specifically, during the initial phase of the Peskas project (July 2017 - April 2019), the standard length measurement used was the fork length (FL), which later changed to the total length (TL) in the subsequent and current version of the project. We utilized the API service offered by the FishBase database to incorporate length-to-length and length-to-weight conversion tables, using information from survey landings to calculate the weight in grams based on the following formula: W = a × L^b Here, W represents the weight in grams, L is the total length (TL) in centimeters, and a and b are the conversion parameters obtained from FishBase for each fish species. The FishBase database provides length-to-length and length-to-weight relationships for over 5,000 fish species. Typically, there are multiple records for the parameters a and b for each species. Since the length measurements in Peskas’ first version pertained to FL, we initially standardized all length measurements to TL using the FishBase length-to-length conversion tables. Subsequently, we applied the TL-to-weight conversion tables to estimate the weights. The FishBase length-to-weight conversion tables offer species-level taxonomic resolution. To derive a singular length-to-weight relationship for each fish group, we calculated the median values of parameters a and b for all species within a particular fish group. To ensure relevance to the region of interest, we refined the species list using FAO country codes (https://www.fao.org/countryprofiles/iso3list/en/) pertinent to Timor-Leste and Indonesia (country codes 626 and 360, respectively). For instance, to ascertain the weight of a catch categorized under the fish group labeled ECN (representing the Echeneidae family), we first identified the species within ECN documented in Timor-Leste and Indonesia. After this, we computed the average values of the parameters a and b for the identified species, which in this case were Echeneis naucrates and Remora remora (as illustrated in the figure below). To address the scarcity of measured nutrient values for fish, which are typically limited to a few species and countries. To overcome this data limitation, MacNeil et al. developed a Bayesian hierarchical model that leverages both phylogenetic information and trait-based information to predict concentrations of seven essential nutrients: calcium, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, selenium, vitamin A, and zinc for both marine and inland fish species globally (see Hicks et al. 2019). For each catch, the nutritional yield was calculated by combining the validated weight estimates for each fish group with the modelled nutrient concentrations. Specifically, we used the highest posterior predictive density values for each of the seven nutrients, which can be found in the repository (https://github.com/mamacneil/NutrientFishbase). For non-fish groups—including octopuses, squids, cockles, shrimps, crabs, and lobsters—nutritional yield information was not available in the NutrientFishbase repository models. We retrieved the necessary data for these groups from the Global food composition database, using the same methodological approach as for the fish groups to estimate their nutritional content. To represent the nutrient concentration associated with each fish group, we used the median value as a summarizing metric. Figure 2.1: Distribution of nutrients’ concentration for each fish group. Dots represent the median, bars represent the 95% confidence interval. 2.2 Checks and limitations Check groups with higher dispersion… Dow we need to narrow species grouping?

We aimed to determine the most appropriate number of distinct groups, or “clusters,” present in our dataset. To achieve this, we used the total within sum of square (WSS) to identify the point at which grouping additional data points together does not significantly improve the clarity of the clustering. Once we established the optimal number of clusters, we applied the K-means clustering method. This is a widely-used technique that organizes data into clusters based on similarity. In our case, we grouped fishing trips together if they showed similar levels of nutrient concentrations. By doing this, we were able to observe patterns and categorize the trips according to their nutritional profiles. To investigate the predictability of nutritional profiles based on fishing strategies, we employed a machine learning model using the XGBoost algorithm. This algorithm is also known for its ability to prevent overfitting, a critical factor for ensuring the reliability of our predictive model. Additionally, XGBoost’s feature importance tool allowed us to identify the most influential predictors on the nutritional profiles. We used quarter, habitat, gear type, vessel type and the interaction between habitat and gear type as predictors variables. The model parameters (number of trees, tree depth, loss reduction, sample size and and early stopping) were dynamically tuned during the training phase to optimize model performance. The dataset was split into two parts: 80% for training the model and 20% for testing. This allocation ensured a comprehensive dataset for training the model while allowing for effective validation. To further enhance the model’s accuracy and generalizability, we applied cross-validation on 10 folds using the training set. In the final stage, we fitted the XGBoost model to the training data and evaluated its performance using metrics such as accuracy, ROC AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics provided insights into the model’s discriminatory ability between different nutritional profile outcomes. The calculation of ROC curves and AUC values offered additional evaluation of the model’s effectiveness. 5.2 Results 5.2.1 Clusters The scatter plot from the k-means clustering (Figure 5.1) showed the distribution of nutrient profiles across different clusters. The first two principal components explained a significant portion of the variance, indicating distinct groupings in nutrient profiles among the fishing trips. The clear separation of clusters in this plot suggests that the fishing trips could be effectively categorized based on their nutrient content. The bar chart (Figure 5.2) displaying nutrient adequacy across clusters indicated the number of individuals meeting the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) per 1kg of catch for various nutrients. The segmentation of bars into different nutrients (calcium, iron, omega-3, protein, vitamin A, zinc) across clusters showed variation in nutritional fulfillment. This suggests that different fishing strategies, represented by different clusters, result in catches with varying nutritional values. Figure 5.1: Cluster analysis of nutrient profiles using k-means clustering. The scatter plot visualizes the distribution of data points in a two-dimensional space defined by the first two principal components which explain 39% and 26% of the variance. The convex hulls represent the boundaries of each cluster, providing a visual guide to the cluster density and separation. Figure 5.2: Distribution of nutrient adequacy across k-means clusters. The bar chart represents the number of individuals meeting the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) per 1kg of catch for each nutrient within different clusters. Each bar is segmented into six categories corresponding to the nutrients analyzed: calcium (dark purple), iron (blue), omega-3 (green), protein (teal), vitamin A (dark teal), and zinc (yellow). Clusters are labeled on the y-axis, indicating distinct groupings based on nutrient profile similarities derived from the cluster analysis. The x-axis quantifies the number of individuals who meet the RNI, highlighting the variation in nutritional fulfillment across clusters. 5.2.2 XGBoost model The model’s predictive capacity was quantitatively assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis across five distinct clusters. The ROC curves (see [ML model interpretation][simple]) illustrate a differential capacity of the model to classify each cluster based on the nutritional profiles derived from various fishing strategies. Cluster 2 and 5 demonstrated superior model performance, indicated by a curve proximate to the top-left, suggesting high sensitivity and specificity. Clusters 1 and 4 showed marginally lower but comparable discrimination ability. Cluster 3 indicated a slight decrease in sensitivity and exhibited the model’s lowest performance, with a curve markedly farther from the ideal top-left position. Collectively, an aggregate AUC of 0.87 signifies a strong overall ability of the model to differentiate between the clusters, albeit with varying degrees of precision. These findings underscore the model’s effectiveness in predicting nutritional outcomes based on fishing strategies, with implications for tailoring nutrient-sensitive fisheries management interventions. Figure 5.3: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves with Data Points for Cluster-Based Classification. The curves delineate the sensitivity versus 1-specificity for the five clusters derived from the XGBoost classification model. Each cluster is represented by a distinct color with data points marked, which illustrates the true positive rate against the false positive rate for each respective cluster. The closeness of each curve to the top-left corner indicates the model’s classification efficacy per cluster, with Cluster 1 and 2 showing the highest performance. The overall model demonstrates substantial predictive accuracy with a composite AUC value of 0.86. metric estimator estimate roc_auc hand_till 0.87 5.3 Checks and limitations The distribution of both habitat types and gear types in our data is uneven. Observations in deep water and reef environments are more common compared to other habitats, and similarly, the use of gill nets is more frequent than other types of fishing gear. We need to evaluate whether this imbalance could lead to biases or issues in our model. Are we considering all the possible potential good predictors? These color are confusing sometimes, consider change the color palette 5.4 Next steps Explore the model: Quantify the importance of each predictor on the model outcome Assess the direction of the effect of each predictor, that is analyze which features have the most impact on driving predictions towards each cluster. [SHAP Values][simple] are a good way to address that. "],["simple.html", "6 In simple terms 6.1 ML model interpretation 6.2 ML model explanation", " 6 In simple terms 6.1 ML model interpretation ROC Curve: The curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various threshold settings. The true positive rate is on the y-axis, and the false positive rate is on the x-axis. Performance: A perfect classifier would have a point in the upper left corner of the graph, where the true positive rate is 1 (or 100%) and the false positive rate is 0. The closer the curve follows the left-hand border and then the top border of the ROC space, the more accurate the test. Diagonal Line: The dotted diagonal line represents a no-skill classifier (e.g., random guessing). A good classifier stays as far away from this line as possible (toward the upper left corner). Area Under the Curve (AUC): The area under each ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of the test’s accuracy. An AUC of 0.5 suggests no discrimination (no better than random chance), while an AUC of 1.0 suggests perfect discrimination. 6.2 ML model explanation SHAP values: help in understanding how each predictor in the dataset contributed to each particular prediction. A high positive SHAP value for a feature increases the probability of a certain prediction, while a high negative SHAP value decreases it.
