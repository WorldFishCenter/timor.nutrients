The plot shows the ranked contribution of each functional fish to the supply of calcium, omega-3, iron, protein, vitamin A, and zinc during the period 2018-2023. Panel B, Comparative analysis of nutritional score versus economic accessibility for key fish groups. This scatter plot displays the relationship between the cumulative nutritional score and the market price for various fish groups within Timor-Leste fishery. The x-axis quantifies the cumulative contribution to the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) for six essential nutrients (zinc, protein, omega-3, calcium, iron, vitamin A) from a 100g portion of each fish group. The y-axis represents the average market price per kilogram for each group. Dot size and the accompanying numerical labels reflect the relative catch percentage of each group, serving as an index of accessibility and availability. Panel C, The bar chart illustrates the contribution of each habitat to the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) for six fundamental nutrients, based on a 100g portion. Each bar is a color-segmented stacked visual, with distinct hues corresponding to individual nutrients, and white numbers within indicating the specific percentage contribution of each nutrient.

To return all, use `return_all = TRUE`. Figure 4.1: Distribution of nutrient adequacy across k-means clusters. The bar chart delineates the number of individuals meeting the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) per 1kg of catch within identified k-means clusters. Each bar is categorized into six segments corresponding to the evaluated nutrients. The clusters are enumerated on the y-axis, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, each representing a group with a distinct nutritional profile as determined by the cluster analysis. The x-axis and the white labels in the bars quantify the count of individuals within each cluster that meet the RNI for the respective nutrients, underlining the variability in nutritional adequacy across clusters. Panels (A) through (D) compare these distributions across different fishing practices and locations, namely Atauro and the Mainland, using all gear types or exclusively gill nets. Figure 4.2: Nutritional profile clustering of fishing trips by region and gear type. Each plot presents a k-means clustering analysis of fishing trip observations, grouped by their nutritional contributions to the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) for six nutrients. The four panels, labeled (A) through (D), display data subsets for Atauro and the Mainland, utilizing all gear types and gill nets specifically. The scatter plots within each panel are charted in a two-dimensional space defined by the first two principal components, with the axes denoting the percentage of explained variance. Points are color-coded to denote distinct nutritional profile clusters derived from the k-means algorithm. Convex hulls define the periphery of each cluster, providing insight into the cluster density and separation. Convex hulls around the clusters aid in visualizing the distribution and delineation of nutritional profile groupings across different fishing methods and geographic areas. 4.1.1 XGBoost model performance Figure 4.3: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves for evaluating the performance of a cluster-based XGBoost classification model across four distinct fishing datasets: Atauro with all gears (a), Atauro with gill nets (b), Mainland with all gears (c), and Mainland with gill nets (d). Each curve represents one of the five clusters obtained from the classification, with different colors marking each cluster. Data points on the curves indicate the trade-off between sensitivity (true positive rate) and 1-specificity (false positive rate) for each cluster. The proximity of the curves to the top-left corner reflects the accuracy of the model in classifying the nutritional profiles into the correct clusters. 4.1.1.1 Models explanation Figure 4.4: To define Figure 4.5: Differential influence of mesh size and habitat x gear type interaction on the nutritional profile predictions in Atauro (A and C) and in Mainland (B and D). Panels A-B: These panels elucidate the impact of mesh size on the probability of observing various nutritional profiles in Atauro (Panel A) and Mainland (Panel B). Each panel includes five plots corresponding to distinct nutritional profiles (NP1-NP5), as forecasted by gill net XGBoost models. The plots exhibit distributions of SHAP values over a range of mesh sizes. Each data point is color-coded to represent different habitats (Beach, Deep, FAD, Mangrove, Reef and Seagrass), clarifying the mesh size’s influence on the accuracy of predictions within each habitat. The y-axis details mesh size ranges, while the x-axis measures SHAP values, where higher values signal a stronger likelihood of a particular nutritional profile’s presence. The size and opacity of each point are proportionate to the SHAP value’s magnitude, visually indicating the significance of each data point in influencing the model’s predictions. Panels C-D: In these panels, the interplay among habitat, gear type, and vessel type (motorized or unmotorized) is analyzed in relation to nutritional profiles in Atauro (Panel C) and Mainland (Panel D). Each plot showcases SHAP value distributions for the five nutritional profiles (NP1-NP5) predicted by XGBoost models applied to datasets encompassing all gear types, excluding gill nets. Data points are color-coded to differentiate between motorized and unmotorized vessels, shedding light on how vessel type, alongside habitat and gear interactions, modulates nutritional profile predictions. Echoing Panels A-B, elevated SHAP values on the x-axis indicate a heightened probability of a specific nutritional profile. Concurrently, the points’ size and opacity correspond to the SHAP values, denoting their relative impact on the outcome prediction.
